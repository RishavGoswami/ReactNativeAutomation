# React Native Automation

<pre>
This will help you cut down the entire process of creating a react native project, right from setting 
up a github repository to initialization and adding the files and finally opening the project in 
VS Code ( It's the best )
</pre>

## Install:
<pre>
git clone "https://github.com/RishavGoswami/ReactNativeAutomation.git"
cd ReactNativeAutomation
source initialize.sh <Keep the files in the root so that it would be easier to access them from anywhere>
Make sure to change all directories to your directories so it look something like '/Users/<Your Username>/path/to/your/project'
</pre>

## Run:

<pre>
To run, simply write 'react-native "name of your project"' 
Note: Keep the project name in lower case
</pre>
